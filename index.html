						<h2>About Me</h2>

						<img id="photo" src="assets/images/apheadshot.png" alt="Anthony Parvin">
						<p>
							I am an effective, results-driven professional with close to 15 years of experience promoting sales efforts through transformative customer service.
						</p>
						<p>
							My key strength is developing and leading enterprise client relationships that surpass corporate goals based on: (1) a deep understanding of customer needs and preferences, (2) product-improvement focused internal dialogue with Product and Engineering leadership, and (3) identifying growth opportunities while orchestrating workable client solutions across multiple products and complex deployments which drive time to value, adoption, and retention.
						</p>
						<p>
							Iâ€™m a data-and-people-driven leader with a proven record of building trust and pushing boundaries, but always with eyes on bottom-line results.
						</p>
